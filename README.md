# Clinical_Trial-Insights
This repository provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing clinical trial data to gain additional insights. It includes a collection of notebooks, scripts, and datasets that can be used to extract, transform, and analyze clinical trial data.

Motivation

Clinical trials are crucial in the development of new treatments and medications. However, the data generated from these trials is often underutilized, resulting in valuable insights being lost. This repository aims to provide a platform for researchers and analysts to extract insights from clinical trial data, enabling them to make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.

Features

Data Extraction: Scripts for extracting data from clinical trial registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, using APIs and web scraping techniques.
Data Transformation: Notebooks for transforming and cleaning clinical trial data, including handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.
Data Analysis: Scripts and notebooks for analyzing clinical trial data, including statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning techniques.
Data Visualization: Notebooks for visualizing clinical trial data, including plots, charts, and heat maps.
